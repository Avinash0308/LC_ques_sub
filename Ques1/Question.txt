Title - Subsequence of Array having Bitwise And of Elements Equal to K.

Given an array of integers, find whether there exist a non - empty subsequnce having Bitwise And (&) of all its element equal to given integer value K. Return True, if there exist a subsequence satsfying the above condition else False.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Example 1:

Input : nums = [1, 7, 3, 4, 2, 13] , K = 5

Output : True

Explanation : Consider the subsequence [nums[1],nums[5]]. The bitwise AND of the elements 7 & 13 = 5.

Example 2:

Input : nums = [1, 3, 4] , K = 2

Output : False

Explanation : It can be shown that no subsequence satisfies the condition.

Constraints:

1 <= N <= 105
0 <= K < 230
0 <= numsi <= 230
